# Go Concurrency Examples

This repository holds various concurrency patterns, along with pertinent examples. This is meant to be used as a reference for inspiration on how to potentially handle certain usecases, but is by no means intended to be production ready code.

## Run Examples

Running the examples is fairly simple, and you will find log output which indicates which example is being run as they execute.

WG Examples:

```bash
go run wg/examples/...
```

Context Examples:
```bash
go run contexts/examples/...
```
